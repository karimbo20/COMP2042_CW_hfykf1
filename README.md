## Frogger Game
Frogger is a vintage arcade game which we used to play when we were young
We had a frogger java code which was not understandable.
That we must refractor and add an additional scenes.

## Refractoring.

We seperated the classes into 4 packages each class is related to specific package. 

Example
digit 
Frogger_main
obstacles
player_act

Repetitive codes are refactored into constants such as path directory for better modifications.

Main no longer adds child nodes to the root nodes.

obstacle factory generates the obstacles in the game.

player_act classes handles the movement of the player and the turtle.

vechiles class for handling trucks and car in the game.
